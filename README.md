# IntersectionSimulation
A recruitment project

# Basic requirements:
  - A realistic crossing simulation, 4-way road
  - The lights have to intelligently adapt to the traffic
  - The app takes commands in JSON
  - Returns a JSON representation of the simulation steps 

# Technologies

## Backend

Uses Kotlin 

## Frontend

I will use React, maybe React Native for mobile capabilities.

## Deployment

In my opinion Dockerization of each service will be a good idea

## Testing

Backend testing depends on the way I will choose to write it with. I can use Junit or Kotest if my main framework will be Kotlin. If however I pick C, then I will have to write a separate programme that will test given cases.
